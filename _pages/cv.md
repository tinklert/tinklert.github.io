* **2016.09 - 2020.06**: Hefei University of Technology (HFUT), Industrial Engineering (Bachelor)

## Internship Experience

* **2024.06 - Present**: **Qimai Technology**, Algorithm Engineer
* **2023.04 - 2023.06**: **Home Original Chicken (Lao Xiang Ji)**, Algorithm Development Intern
* **2022.06 - 2023.03**: **Zhejiang Yingyang Asset**, Quantitative Research Intern

## Research Experience

* **2025.03 - 2025.08**: **Malicious Consumer Detection Algorithm Design**
  * **Description**: Jointly modeled consumer cross-channel behavior and cognitive resource investment during fine-grained page browsing processes. Utilized Graph Neural Networks (GNN) to mine user IP address networks for detecting malicious consumers.
  * **Achievement**: The algorithm was applied in the internship company, serving a large listed tea beverage enterprise.

* **2024.04 - 2025.03**: **Consumer Marketing Response Prediction Based on Decoupled Attribution**
  * **Description**: Decomposed consumer repurchase behavior into "inertia" and "marketing stimulus". Used Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNN) to model long-term user inertia, and dynamic time-series models to capture marketing fatigue and immediate reactions. Employed a decoupled attention mechanism to attribute the deviation between prediction and reality for precise consumer response prediction.

* **2023.05 - 2024.01**: **Full-Store All-Product Sales Prediction Based on Consumer Preference Mining**
  * **Description**: Adopted a two-stage deep learning approach. First, used Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks to mine user groups with similar preferences. Then, utilized a consumer preference attention mechanism to fuse data for sales prediction.
  * **Achievement**: The algorithm was launched in the internship company, serving over a thousand stores.

* **2022.05 - 2023.03**: **Shared Mobility Demand Prediction Based on Graph Neural Networks**
  * **Description**: Combined Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to extract spatial location features and temporal demand information of shared bike stations, respectively, integrating multi-dimensional factors for demand prediction modeling.

* **2021.09 - 2022.05**: **Business Process Fraud Detection Based on Deep Learning**
  * **Description**: Comprehensively analyzed employee transaction data, personal information, and reporting texts to extract multi-dimensional features and build a fraud detection algorithm. On a real-world dataset, the model achieved a recall rate of 92% and an AUC of 97%.

* **2019.12 - 2020.06**: **Road Pedestrian Detection System Design Based on Machine Vision** (Graduation Thesis)
  * **Description**: Focused on road pedestrian detection scenarios, improved the traditional HOG feature detection method, integrated Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) for foreground extraction and denoising, and combined with LBP features to enhance detection performance.
  * **Achievement**: The graduation design was awarded "2020 Hefei University of Technology Excellent Undergraduate Graduation Design".
